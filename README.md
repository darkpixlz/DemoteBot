# DemoteBot

---

This was really just a joke. It functions though.

## Setup

---
add the bot token and roles in the code
run `npm install node.js@` then `node DemoteBot.js`

invite your bot with admin perms, run /demote, then @mention who you want to demote.


---

again, this is a joke so i probably wont be fixing this if it breaks
